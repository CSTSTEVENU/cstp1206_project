## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `"npm init : "`,
Generate a pakeage.json file, this file is mainly used to record the details of the project, it will be used in the project development package, as well as the details of the project recorded in the project. Convenience will be more convenient in future iterations and project migrations. It is also to prevent the project from being unable to run normally if a package is mistakenly deleted in the later project maintenance.

### `"npm init -y : "`,
Generate it without having it ask any question

### `"npm i express : "`,
Express is the Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to: Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

### `"npm i express : "`,
nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

### `"npm i --save-dev nodemon : "`,
nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

### `"npm start : "`,
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

### `"npm i dotenv : "`,
The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"git init : "`,
The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

### `"git clone : "`,
A Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
 
### `"git pull : "`,
Used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.

### `"git status : "`,
Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.

### `"git add : "`,
Adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area. git add is an important command - without it, no git commit would ever do anything. Sometimes, git add can have a reputation for being an unnecessary step in development.

### `"git commit -m : "`,
Record the state of the git repo, what the folders and files are like at that time. With the commit, we can rebuild the whole git repo which is described by the trees and blobs.

### `"git checkout -b  <branchname> : "`,
Used to switch through branches. If you want to merge two branches, switch to one of them and type. git merge $BRANCHNAME. where $BRANCHNAME is the name of the other branch.

### `"git push : "`,
Used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.
